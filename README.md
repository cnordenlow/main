## Welcome to cnordenlow Github

*The purpose of this GitHub is to gather and share information. Working as an Portfolio Manager for Fixed Income a lot of my focus is to be able to track and break down data in a matter of seconds. To be able to do this, programming is key, but also to understand what lies beyond the numbers. This page can be about some of this. But this page can also be about totally different things. Please contact me if you have any questions or thoughts.* 

##### The aim for this page is create different templates and settings to be able to code, break down and analyse data in different ways.
